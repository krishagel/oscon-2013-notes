###Quantifying Your Fitness

It doesn't matter how super accurate the tracker is that you're using.

BodyMedia is the first device she is showing off.  Does track activites and sleep pretty accurately.  No way to track calories consumed directly.  Syncs to iPhone.  Battery lasts several days.

BodyMedia has an api to get a bunch of the information.  

FitBit - Sleep tracking w/ trigger, also has a scale, activity tracking via motion sensor.

They do have a very good, easy to use api.  PHP Libraries are available on GitHub.  Also have an affiliate program.  Doesn't track cycling, weight lifting, etc very well.  The bodymedia does much better at that.

Jawbone Up.  Wristband.  Battery lasts a very long time.  Does sleep tracking without having to tell it.  No Open API, integrates with Runkeeper, IFTTT, MapMyFitness.  Jawbone just bought bodymedia so they will be hopefully both be better in the future.

Withings Pulse, small tracker w/clip, wristband.  Activity tracking.  Heart rate reading on demand, sleep tracking w/ trigger.  Withings also has a scale.  They have an iphone app, but the website isn't great now with the pulse.  Has to sync to a smartphone.  They have a basic api, but is is getting more information.

Basis: highly accurate - sweat, temperature, accellerometer, sleep tracking.  Looks like a geeky watch, heart rate monitor.  This one is her favorite of all of them.  It watches your habits and sets goals for you based on your habits.  Helps you to set goals based off of everything you do.

Runkeeper health graph

Runkeeper, zombies run, myfitnesspal, runno / jog of war are all iphone fitness apps.

Zombies Run is a really interesting app based on stories and getting you to run.  New apps should look into this.

Myfitnesspal is the best food logger.

Runno / jog of war is another fun game on iphone.

fitocracy is another game type fitness app
