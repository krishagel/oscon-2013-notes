There needs to be coordinated efforts into what technology solutions are built, so that multiple people don't build the same apps, or repeat the same work in a crisis situation.

Crisis Mappers Network - coordinated maps and data on crisis'

three systems are available to track people in a disaster, red cross safe & well, sahanafoundation has a product, and google people finder.  Need to combine the data together, or look in all three in an emergency.

It sounds like a lot of these humanitrian groups use google tools (google apps) to run their organizations.

maps, hacks, and data are what they all like to focus on

retrospecitve and time-series data are important to look at after the fact of crisis events.  

statisticians, machine learning, artificial intelligence are all skills that they will be needing moving forward

any skill sets you have are needed somewhere in the hfoss community

social coding for good is another organization as well.
