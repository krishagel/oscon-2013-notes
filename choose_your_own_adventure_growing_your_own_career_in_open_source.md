Good idea -- Add a slide into your presentations at conferences that opinions are your own.

- Establish your current baseline - get existential
- Discovering your options - understand where you are, and what you want
- Thinking about what works for you - It might not always be what you expect
- Perspective: short and long term goals - 18 months is a good long term goals
- Make no sudden moves - a note on self-care and taking care of you, because sometimes its not them, it's you.
- Perspective applied: short and long term gains.  make sure to look beyond just monetary gains
- unexpected adventures & opportunities
- re-evaluation level, your own metrics of success

Usually you will learn the most from the things you really hate.

Your bosses want to see that you are learning new things

Big theme of the talk is self-awareness and self-discovery

Go to user groups and learn technical topics, but also to network and meet people

you're going to make mistakes, that's ok, make new and better mistakes next time

doing nothing is easy, doing something is hard.

On opportunities in Open Source - Stop messing around and do some work

Go out there and get messy...
