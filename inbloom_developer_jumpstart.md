###inBloom Developer Jumpstart

Working to be a non-profit to build commodity services to fuel a more efficient market in K-12 ed-tech.

two core services 

- inBloom Data Store
	- educational data model
	- all data in one place
	- oauth2
	- single sign on
	- json/rest
	- tied in with ed-fi somehow
	- easier integration for developers
	- one common api for everyone to interface
	- it is NOT:
		- dashboard
		- testing product
		- analytics engine
		- app store
- learning registry index
	- builds on top of open-source Learning Registry
	- provides a scalable REST API to smart searches in LR
	- library of resources available (OER Commons, etc & commercial)
	- find me a video under five minutes of length that teaches specific common core or state standard
	- paradata? how those education resources are being used in classrooms
	- it is NOT:
		- content repository
		- not a recommendation engine
		- not a search engine (although there is an index)
		- not replacing any products out there
