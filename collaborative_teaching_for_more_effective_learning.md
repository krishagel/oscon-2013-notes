Looks like he is going to propose to use GitHub as an LMSâ€¦

Raise issues and questions to one place

Getting peer reviews from other students to assist

Students can comment on someone else's code

This coude be useful in a programming class, or maybe something like robotics

Teacher could build repo for the class, each student can build repos for each project.  You could also have group repos for group projects.

There are a lot of things like notifications built into GitHub that could be useful for a classroom teacher.

Issues are great repositories of information for people to look back into previous classes.

Sharing between teachers could be very beneficial as well, they could work together and have conversations/share work together.

Think outside the box and see what other course material could go in here.  Not just programming classes, but say Italian, or Biology, or Home Ec, etc.

Star repositories that are good other teaching examples.  Also, follow other repos of courses and such to build a whole network.

github.com/tuftsdev - computer science department

github.com/projectblacklight/blacklight - multiple university project

github.com/edu Free accounts for teachers.

Really cool thoughts about doing english classes up on GitHub.  Students writing papers, and then collaborating on those together.  Plain text, no need for anything else.  Also, could do Markdown.
