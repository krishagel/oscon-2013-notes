###How Not To Make Money In Open Source

This talk is a negative talk in that it consists almost entirely of things you should not do.  Base off The Art of Demotivation by E.L. Kersten.

- You can't sell things you don't own
- people like to buy things that solve their problems
- people like to buy things they understand.

People are fundamentally lazy.  If you don't give them a reason to call you, most of them won't.

ASL, MIT, BSD are all business friendly licenses.

List commercial offerings on your website.

Commercially successful open source projects have a very low conversion rate from downloads to paying licenses (like 0.1%)

Failing to capture leads or being lazy with follow-up can ensure that your few potential customers slip right through the cracks.

If you create something of value, people will begin trying to sell things for you and won't give you any of the money.

Avoid the "ghetto latte" idea.  If you can just buy a shot of espresso and add in free milk, then that is not a good idea.

Draw the line at where there is a big difference in complexity.  Or you can just put all your eggs into the support basket and give everything away for free.

Don't use a dual license.  It just doesn't work out well, it becomes too confusing.

Don't price your product with an offbeat pricing model.  People need to be able to commpare open source products right along side commercial products.

Make sure that work you do in your off time, is not a work product, and not owned by your employer.

Clean up your source code, don't leave it messy.  Make sure you have a branching scheme and release plan.  Make frequent and complete releases.  Supporting software means that you have to be able to know when a bug is fixed and that no new bugs have been introduced.

Make sure you have contributor license agreements so you know who genuinely owns the project.

Go to the apache project and use their forms for cla's.  CLA Hub is another location for that.

Mulesoft or Bitnami are examples of Saas providers of open source.  Make sure you study hard on the price point.  You don't want to jump around on price points.

AGPL is a license to look at to make sure that someone doesn't take your open source product and then provide a hosting service with it.

Open Source is like going outside naked.  You should do a lot of prep work before you do it, not after.
